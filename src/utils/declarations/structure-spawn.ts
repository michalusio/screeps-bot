     * @returns One of the following codes:
     * ```
     * OK                       0   The operation has been scheduled successfully.

     * ERR_BUSY                 -4  The spawn is already in process of spawning another creep.
     * ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_ENERGY    -6  The spawn and its extensions contain not enough energy to create a creep with the given body.
     * ERR_INVALID_ARGS         -10 Body is not properly described or name was not provided.
     * ERR_RCL_NOT_ENOUGH       -14 Your Room Controller level is insufficient to use this spawn.
